			Hey there! I'm a web developer with a knack for creating awesome
			software that people absolutely love using. My journey began when I
			completed a Web Development bootcamp back in 2017. After that, I
			scored a gig with the Australian Football League as a junior
			frontend developer, where I got to work my magic with Vue.js. It was
			a blast enhancing the digital presence of such an iconic
			organization and creating seamless user experiences. However, I
			eventually decided to pursue new challenges, and that led me to join
			the incredible team at A Cloud Guru as a software engineer. There, I
			immersed myself in the world of GraphQL, AWS, and React, learning
			tons along the way. Now, I'm on the lookout for my next adventure â€“
			an opportunity to build software that people can't get enough of,
			while having a blast and soaking up even more knowledge.
