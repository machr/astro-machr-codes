        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
          I’m a Javascript developer. My goal is to make software that people
          enjoy using, and have fun in the process
        </p>
        <p>
          Hey there! I'm a web developer with a knack for creating awesome
          software that people absolutely love using. My journey began when I
          completed a Web Development bootcamp back in 2017. After that, I
          scored a gig with the Australian Football League as a junior frontend
          developer, where I got to work my magic with Vue.js. It was a blast
          enhancing the digital presence of such an iconic organization and
          creating seamless user experiences. However, I eventually decided to
          pursue new challenges, and that led me to join the incredible team at
          A Cloud Guru as a software engineer. There, I immersed myself in the
          world of GraphQL, AWS, and React, learning tons along the way. Now,
          I'm on the lookout for my next adventure – an opportunity to build
          software that people can't get enough of, while having a blast and
          soaking up even more knowledge.
